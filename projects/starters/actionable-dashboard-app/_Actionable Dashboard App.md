# Pattern Application
### Actionable Dashboard App
A TIBCO Cloud Spotfire Dashboard showing TIBCO Cloud LiveApps cases and related data. Mashed up with process, notes, documents so that a user can mark data in Spotfire and then run an action on the selected "case" context. 
A process implementation could be "contact customer" or a case creator like "investigation". All Process forms would be rendered in same UI.
