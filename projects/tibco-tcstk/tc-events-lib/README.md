# TcEventsLib

This library provides services and components for use with TIBCO Cloud Events.

## Restrictions

In order to use this library API calls must be proxied through TIBCO Cloud Mashery so the CORs headers can be added to the API calls and the cookies passed correctly.

Refer to the TCSTK events template apps to configure the Mashery proxy.
