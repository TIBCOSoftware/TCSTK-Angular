#### Step 2) Build App
Build a new cloud starter using the Cloud CLI

There are 2 ways of doing this; interactive and non-interactive. 

##### a) the Interactive Option
Your first option is to start the cloud cli and go through the interactive menu.
In this example we just start the cloud cli, in a folder where you want to create the new cloud starter, as follows:

```bash
tcli
```

Then enter your TIBCO Cloud User name and Password. Note: You can also leave the password blank so it won't be stored; but then you have to enter it each time you start the Cloud CLI.
Then the NPM packages will be installed and eventually you will see this message:

##### b) the command line Option
Your second option is provide the name of your cloud starter and the template to use on the command line, for example:
```bash
tcli new MyAwesomeCloudStarter -t "Case Manager App (GIT)"
```

#### Step 3) Start App
No you can go into Cloud Starter folder and start it up

```bash
cd MyAwesomeCloudStarter/
tcli start
```

Now you can reach your Cloud Starter App on:  https://localhost:4200/
