### Customize an App
Every Pattern app will have a set of initial configuration files that store in an App specific Shared State at runtime.

This to quickly adjust Settings, and make Apps more Use Case specific.

Check out all Details directly for each Pattern App. e.g

- change App Name
- adjust Landing Page
  - Welcome Message
  - Background
- adjust used Roles
  - Permission Control
- make it Live Apps Case Type specific 
  - Colors
  - Icons

and more.
