### Get Started Guide
This Angular.IO TIBCO Cloud Composer Repository stores ready to use Sample Pattern Application and UI Components. All of them build to use within your custom Implementation as a whole reusable App or just your preferred Components.<br>

### Our Tooling
We use the following Tools for your best Development Experience:

- Public NPM, stores a Library of TIBCO Components
- Public GitHub, to collaborate on available Components and Libraries
- Angular.IO Schematics, to create new Components 

First of all, we want to get you started and get your environment ready with your own version of the Case Manager Application Template.
