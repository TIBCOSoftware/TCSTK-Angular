**Note**<br>
This Pattern App is using some Services Offerings of the TIBCO Cloud LiveApps Subscription, e.g. Shared State to store Application Configurations.
Also if the App should be hosted on TIBCO Cloud, a TIBCO Cloud LiveApps Subscription is needed to upload the App to the Web Resource Provisioning Service.
